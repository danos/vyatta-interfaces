# If a feature is listed here and set to 1 then it means that we have support
# for it in some platform.  If in here, but not specified in the platform.conf
# file then it will be blocked at config validation time.
# If feature is listed but set to 0, it indicates that on all platforms for
# that type of interface it is not supported. For example, vlan-modify
# policy is set to 0 for hardware-interfaces so not supported on any platform
# for hardware interfaces. Similiary, storm-control is 0 for software interfaces
# meaning its not supported in software on any platform
